    "Let's be honest, professors all vary in teaching style (and quality). Students tend to be extremely vocal about their opinions of professors. Everyone is looking out for one other. Friends want each other to get the best professors that they can and avoid those that they may not learn the best from. As a result, online platforms have been created to house student reviews of professors, the most commonly known website being Rate My Professors, which has data on over 1.3 million professors, 7,000 schools and 15 million ratings. Three student at the University of Maryland, College Park even took the initiative to create their own platform to gather specifically UMD professor ratings, [PlanetTerp](https://planetterp.com/), which includes over 11,000 professors and 16,000 reviews. PlanetTerp has the additional feature of including course grades for each UMD course; as of right now there are nearly 300,000 course grades stored on the site.\n",

    "Starting in 2013, The Diamondback, UMD's premier independent student newspaper, began publishing an annual salary guide: [The Diamondback Salary Guide](https://salaryguide.dbknews.com/). The Diamondback Salary Guide displays every university employee's yearly pay in an easily digestible format for all to view. This information is public data provided to The Diamondback by the university itself; The Diamondback simply made this data more accessible to all by posting it on a single website.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Diamondback Salary Guide states, \"[w]e won't tell you what conclusions to draw from these numbers, but it's our hope that they'll give you the information you need to reflect on your own.\" In this final tutorial, we plan to do just that: compare both the salaries and ratings of UMD professors and reflect on our findings. From our own past experiences, we have observed that our favorite professors are not always the ones being paid the highest salaries. We are interested in the possiblity of a potential correlation between these two attributes. If there is a correlation between professor salary and rating, what is it? If a correlation exists, can we use this information to predict professor salary based on student reviews and vice versa?"
